## History
This is fork from excellent work from [norcross/airplane-mode](https://github.com/norcross/airplane-mode/). We needed something to help local development and to disable all core update checks from production servers.

## About
Disables WordPress from connecting to wp.org servers. Disables users from installing anything from wp-admin. We use composer for installing/updating sites.

## Current Actions
* replaces all instances of Gravatar with a local image to remove external call
* disables installing plugins and themes
* disables all WP update checks for core, themes, and plugins

## Changelog

See [CHANGES.md](CHANGES.md).

## Roadmap
* Disable all connections which cause errors without internet connections so that we can use whoops in local development without annoying errors.
